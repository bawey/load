\section{Use cases}

The project has never moved beyond the prototype phase and there is no deployment mechanism in place or whatsoever.
So far it has only been launched directly from the Eclipse IDE.

\subsection{Overview}
\subsection{Details}

Until the proper, Esper-powered approach was taken, resolving EPL dependencies used to be handled by the means of inserting extra \texttt{#include} statements and determining the deployment order by hand.
Some remnants of that are present in the EPL loading code or in the EPL itself and should have been removed.

\subsection{Implemented checks}
A summary of implemented checks along with some brief notes can be found in an xml file under the \texttt{epl/xml}
